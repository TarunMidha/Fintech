## Landscape

Over the past 5-10 years, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has become increasingly popular as financing. This lending allows people to borrow money from other individuals or organizations rather than through traditional banking institutions. In that time, many innovations have been made in the industry, allowing it to grow and become a viable alternative to conventional banking and financing.

1. P2P lending over the past 5–10 years is the growth in technology-driven platforms that facilitate the peer-to-peer process. These platforms use algorithms to match borrowers with lenders and make it easier for both parties to manage the process from start to finish. This automation has made it much simpler for borrowers to access the funds they need quickly and for lenders to find qualified borrowers with low-risk profiles.

1. P2P lending is the growth of crowdfunding platforms that allow multiple individuals or organizations to invest small amounts of money into a single loan. This arrangement enables a borrower to access more significant loan amounts without finding a single lender to put up the entire piece. This has opened up P2P lending to individuals and businesses who might not have been able to get financing through traditional channels.

1. P2P lending over the past 5–10 years is the growth of alternative credit scoring methods. Traditional banks rely heavily on credit score information to determine a borrower’s risk profile, but P2P lending platforms have developed new ways of evaluating borrowers that consider other factors such as current income and job history. This has allowed lenders to assess the risk associated with each potential borrower more accurately. 

These developments have allowed P2P lending to become a viable option for borrowers and lenders. As the industry continues to grow, we expect to see more innovations that will make it easier for people to access finance quickly and securely.

## Competitors

One of the main competitors to goPeer is P2P lending platform RateSetter. This platform was launched in 2010 and has experienced significant growth since then, with over 100,000 lenders using their services to invest £1 billion into various businesses and individuals.

Though both companies offer similar services, goPeer differs from RateSetter in several key ways. goPeer offers a marketplace-style platform, where users can browse through listings from a variety of lenders and choose who they would like to borrow from or lend to. This is not possible on RateSetter, which uses an automated algorithm to match borrowers with investors.

goPeer also offers more flexibility and control to both borrowers and lenders, with lower interest rates and more customisable loan terms. Additionally, goPeer’s registration process is much simpler than RateSetter's, with no credit checks or background checks required in order to use the platform.

Overall, goPeer provides an accessible alternative to RateSetter for those who want to borrow or lend money. With its user-friendly interface and flexible loan terms, goPeer stands out from the competition as a reliable and easy-to-use platform for peer-to-peer lending.

## Recommendations

Blockchain technology can offer several advantages to P2P lenders by streamlining the lending process and making it more secure. 
 
1.  Offers an immutable ledger of transactions that can be used to track borrower and lender information. This provides transparency that is not available in traditional banking systems, making it easier to monitor and verify loan details. 
 
1.  Transactions are faster and more reliable than traditional methods. This improves the efficiency of P2P lending platforms, allowing lenders to approve loans quickly and get paid faster. 
 
1. Enhanced security by using encryption techniques, making it virtually impossible for hackers to steal information or tamper with records. Additionally, because the ledger is immutable and distributed across multiple computers, it eliminates the risk of a single point of failure. 
 
Blockchain technology can help P2P lending platforms become more efficient and secure. With increased transparency, faster transactions, and enhanced security, lenders can feel confident in the safety of their investments while borrowers benefit from better terms and lower rates. As such, blockchain-based P2P lending systems are the clear choice for those looking to take advantage of this growing industry.
