## What Is It

Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is an alternative approach to traditional bank lending and involves people borrowing and lending money without using a middleman financial institution. It has emerged as an essential way for individuals to access loans or invest their money, with lenders charging interest on loans to make a return. 

## Why This Matters

The growth of peer-to-peer lending has been phenomenal in recent years, with the global marketplace projected to reach over $1 trillion by 2024. It is here to stay due to its flexibility, affordability, and convenience for lenders and borrowers. 




## Why This May be Interesting

* Peer-to-peer lending has become increasingly popular in recent years due to its potential of high returns, ease of access, and low entry costs. This type of investing involves connecting lenders directly with borrowers without using a third-party intermediary such as a bank or traditional financial institution. The borrower must submit an application and credit report for review, and if approved, the loan is funded by several lenders. 

* The lender has access to higher returns and more control over risk management. They can select from a wide variety of borrowers and customize their portfolios based on individual preferences. For example, investors may focus on loans with lower interest rates and shorter repayment terms. They can also diversify their investments by lending to various borrowers and sectors. 

* The potential returns from peer-to-peer lending are attractive, but investors must also be mindful of the risks involved. Not all borrowers are creditworthy, and it is possible to incur losses on certain investments. Additionally, legal and taxation issues may need to be considered, depending on the jurisdiction. Despite this, peer-to-peer lending can still be viable for investors looking to diversify their portfolios and access higher returns.

* Understand the Risks: Peer-to-peer lending carries certain risks that you should take into consideration before entering an agreement. These include your credit score, the loan terms, and any potential legal or financial ramifications.

* Know Your Lender: Before engaging in a peer-to-peer loan agreement, it is essential to know exactly who you are dealing with. Research the individual or company offering the loan to make sure they are reputable and trustworthy.

* Document Everything: Always make sure all of the relevant information is documented and signed before you enter into any agreement. This includes details such as loan amounts, repayment schedules, interest rates, late fees, and more.

* Be Realistic: Setting a realistic budget with an affordable repayment plan is key to successful peer-to-peer lending. Make sure you can afford the loan and have enough to cover the repayment.

* Donâ€™t Be Too Optimistic: It is important not to be overly optimistic when it comes to peer-to-peer lending, as there are no guarantees that you will be able to repay the loan or get your money back.

* Have an Exit Plan: It is important to have a plan in place for if the loan agreement does not work out. This includes things such as alternative repayment options, refinancing, or even bankruptcy if necessary. 

* Seek Professional Advice: If you are considering engaging in a peer-to-peer lending arrangement, it is always a good idea to seek advice from a financial professional. They can help you make sure you are making the right decision and provide guidance on how best to manage your loan.
